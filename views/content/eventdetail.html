          <p><span>DHOLAK: </span> Marriage is a big occasion in India. But the new generation denies it and wants to do things simply without following the old traditions. Ramdev, the bridegroom is on his nerves with his family and the traditions forced
            upon him.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>YAADEIN: </span> In this tale, an old woman is shown alone in darkness until her friend decides to visit her. For that time that corner lights up with giggles and songs and shadows of memories.</p>

        <li>
          <p><span>SAMADHI BHAI RAMSINGH: </span> Our country thrives on blind faith. This story is about Ramsingh who goes to a village and starts giving Chirayta (ayurvedic medicine) to everyone for free. </p>
